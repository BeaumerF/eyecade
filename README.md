# Eyecade
With eyecade, you can play 3 games with your eyes (or mouse if you don't have Tobii Eye Tracker).

  - Eye Pong: a Pong game where one of the two players has to track the ball with his eyes to make it visible

  - Eye Brick: an Arkanoid game where the first player must watch the bricks with his eyes so that the second does not break them

We made this project during the forty-eight hours of the [Addon Game Jam 2017](https://addon.events/) with a strong interest for the innovative gameplay that could offer us the eye tracker. The main theme of this project was 1) hand spinner, 2) filter tip, and 3) anaglyph glasses.
