# Eyecade
With eyecade, you can play 3 games with your eyes (or mouse if you don't have Tobii Eye Tracker).

  - Eye Pong: a Pong game where one of the two players have to track the ball with his eyes to make it visible

  - Eye Brick: an Arkanoid game where the first player must watch the bricks with his eyes so that the second does not break them

  - Eye Smoke: a single player game where you have to destroy mobs caused by smoking in the lungs by turning one of the three propellers with your eyes
